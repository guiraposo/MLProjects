# MLProjects
Repository for training and practicing different algorithms and techniques in Data Science. The projects here presented are a mix of practical cases in online courses and other personal case studies that I find interesting. 

## Folders:
1. **Movie Classification:**
In this folder we explore the method of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and using PyTorch. We apply this method to a classfication problem to predict the rating of movies.

2. **Stock_Trend_RNN**
In this project we apply a simple Recurrent Neural Network algorithm for time-series analysis. Here we apply it to predict the trend of a given stock according to some the data at previous instances.

3. **ANN_Churn**
   In this example, we use the TensorFlow library to implement a simple Artificial Neural Network to predict the Churn rate for a bank.
